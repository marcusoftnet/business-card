  "desc": "Get agile to work in practice - is my motto. This had led me to take interest in all kind of things: Kanban, Lean, TDD, Specification by example, Node, Continuous Delivery, server less technologies, and I have also contributed to open source frameworks such as SpecFlow, Nancy, RiotJs and Koa. I've spent 2 years working for the Salvation Army in Indonesia to help the health services there to become more effective. I've written two books; Kanban in Action (http://bit.ly/theKanbanBook) that describes the fundamentals and a business novel about how lean/agile principles helped us to save a hospital in Indonesia (http://bit.ly/bungsubook).",
